![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

## Description
This application was initial built for the final assignment for the UofT Full Stack Coding bootcamp. I continued working on this project past the course, changing the styling, adding in new features and reworking existing ones. It is currently a fully functional full stack E-Commerce web application, where the site owner can list products in different categories, and customers can search and purchase those products.
